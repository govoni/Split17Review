\section*{Introduction}

The VBSCan COST Action Network aims at a consistent and coordinated study of vector-boson scattering (VBS)
from the phenomenological and experimental point of view, 
for the best exploitation of the data that will be delivered by the LHC future operations.
The community is organized in five working groups,
three of which are dedicated to the scientific aspects of the collaboration.
One is dedicated to the Theoretical Understanding of the VBS process,
which targets a detailed description of the VBS signal 
and relative backgrounds in the Standard Model (SM) case, 
as well as effective field theory (EFT) modeling of beyond the SM (BSM) effects.
A second one focuses on Analysis Techniques,
studying the definition of data analysis protocols and agreements 
to maximise the significance of VBS analyses at hadron colliders, 
promoting the communication between theory and experiments.
A third one fosters the optimal deployment of VBS studies 
in the hadron collider experiments data analyses.
\newline{}
The VBSCan Network is composed by theoretical and experimental physicists from both the ATLAS and CMS experiments,
as well as data analysis experts and industrial partners.
The first general meeting of the Network happened at the end of June 2017 in Split~\cite{kickoff}
and was dedicated to reviews of the data analysis status of the art,
as well as of the theoretical and experimental instruments
relevant for VBS studies.
This report contains
a summary of the talks presented\footnote{All the presentation material can be found at \url{https://indico.cern.ch/event/629638/}.} during the first general meeting of the Network,
divided into sections corresponding to the Network working groups.

\section*{Conclusions}

The VBSCan COST Action
gathers experts from the experimental, theoretical, and statistics communities
to find a common strategy to tackle the great issues presented
by the measurement of the VBS processes at hadron colliders.
With an engagement that will last four years,
the community aims at going beyond the state of the art
in the instruments and knowledge needed for the best exploitation
of existing and future data 
that will be made available by the LHC and future colliders,
to determine the high-energy behaviour of the very core of the Standard Model,
the electroweak symmetry breaking.
