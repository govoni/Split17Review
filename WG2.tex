\subsection{Experimental Overview -- N. Lorenzo Martinez}
\begin{itemize}
\item Blabla overview of experimental resuls
\item Highlight 5 sigma in ww
\item More channels getting covered => important for EFT interpretation: different channels sensitive to different couplings.
\item Would be good to have more complete coverage from both experiments
\item Notable difference between analysis when treating unitarization => hurdle for combinations of EFT interpretation
\item Notable differences between analysis when treating EWK QCD interference => hurdle for comparison/combination of SM results.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Selection Criteria -- X. Janssen}

Goal have realistic phase-space definition for theory- and feasability studies

Comparison of selections of existing analysis.
Reasonable baseline possible for ``easy'' channels (e.g. WW), where signal is accessible in cut \& count style analysis.

Ultimately difficult for signals with very low cross-section / BR / efficiency (e.g. ZZ), as these require very loose phase-space selection + sophisticated MVA final selection, which is not easily modeled for the above purpose.

\subsection{Prospects -- M. Kobel}

Major topics:
Longitudinal component.
purest channel (WW), polarization is not accessible. Channels with easy pol. typically have high QCD contributions.
Some ideas to improve by devising polarization depndent variables.

BSM interpretations.
Advantages / Disadvantages of EFTs vs more explicit resonance modeling.
EFT advantage: generic, complete, computations avaliable.
EFT disadvantage: unitarization issues. Poor modeling of resonance tails (i.e. the ``$<<$'' in the usual assumption of $<<\Lambda$ in EFTs can be ver large)

Need some figures here?
