In the past years, the study of the VBS processes attracted lots of interests in the theory community, (see \emph{e.g.}\ Ref.~\cite{Rauch:2016pai} for 
a recent review).
The activities range from providing precise predictions for the VBS signal and background processes in the SM, to studying the sensitivity of these 
processes on new physics effects, by means of effective theories or by studying the polarisation patterns of the heavy gauge bosons involved.
The program of the meeting reflects these avenues.

\subsection{Complete NLO corrections to ${\rm W^+ W^+}$ scattering}
%  M. Pellen

The first VBS process that has been observed during the run~I of the LHC is the same-sign WW production~\cite{Aad:2014zda,Aaboud:2016ffv,Khachatryan:2014sta}.
This observation has already been confirmed by a measurement of the CMS collaboration at the 13 TeV run~II~\cite{CMS:2017adb}.
In view of the growing mole of data which will be collected by the experiments, and of the consequent reduction of the uncertainties affecting these measurements, precise theoretical predictions become necessary.

In that respect next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections to such signatures should be computed.
So far, NLO computations have focused on NLO QCD corrections to the VBS process~\cite{Jager:2009xx,Jager:2011ms,Denner:2012dz,Rauch:2016pai} and its QCD-induced irreducible background process~\cite{Melia:2010bm,Melia:2011gk,Campanario:2013gea,Baglio:2014uba,Rauch:2016pai}.
No NLO EW corrections had been computed and the NLO QCD computations relied on the so-called VBS approximation.
In Ref.~\cite{Biedermann:2017bss}, for the first time, all leading order (LO) and NLO contributions to the full ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$ process have been reported\footnote{The $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{7}\right)}$ corrections
were computed previously in Ref.~\cite{Biedermann:2016yds}.}.
As the full amplitudes are used, this amounts to computing three LO contributions and four NLO contributions.
At LO, the three contributions are the EW process [order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{6}\right)}$], its QCD-induced counterpart [order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}^2\alpha^{4}\right)}$] as well as the interference [order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^{5}\right)}$].
Due to the VBS event selection applied to the final state, the full process is dominated by the purely EW contribution (see Table~\ref{table:LOVBS}).
This EW contribution features the proper VBS diagrams but also background diagrams where, for example, the W bosons are simply radiated off the quark lines.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c||c|}

\label{table:LOVBS}
\end{table}

At NLO, the four contributions arise at the orders $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{7}\right)}$, $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^{6}\right)}$, $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}^{2}\alpha^{5}\right)}$, and $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}^{3}\alpha^{4}\right)}$. 
An interesting feature is that the orders $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^{6}\right)}$ and $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_{\rm s}^{2}\alpha^{5}\right)}$ receive both EW and QCD corrections.
Thus, at NLO (as opposed to LO) it is not possible to strictly distinguish the EW process from the QCD-induced process.
As it can be seen from Table~\ref{table:NLOVBS}, at the level of the fiducial cross section, the largest corrections are the ones of order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{7}\right)}$.
These are the NLO EW corrections to the EW processes.

\begin{table}

The sum of all the NLO contributions is in the last column.

\label{table:NLOVBS}
\end{table}

This is also reflected in two differential distributions in the transverse momentum for the hardest jet and invariant mass for the two leading jets in Figure~\ref{fig:VBSALL}.
At LO, the QCD-induced process as well as the interference are rather suppressed due to the typical VBS event selection (as for the fiducial cross section).
This is exemplified in the invariant mass of the two leading jets where, at high invariant mass, the QCD-induced background becomes negligible.
At NLO, the bulk of the corrections originates from the large EW corrections to the EW process at order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{7}\right)}$.
In particular, they display the typical behaviour of Sudakov logarithms that grow large in the high-energy limit.
Note that the contribution from initial-state photon is also shown but is not taken into account in the definition of the NLO predictions.
This contribution is rather small and relatively constant in shape over the whole range studied here.
Finally, as at NLO it is not possible to isolate the EW production from its irreducible backgrounds, a global measurement of the full process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$ with all components is desirable.

In addition, the NLO photon-induced contributions of order $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha^{7}\right)}$ is provided separately.}
\label{fig:VBSALL}
\end{figure}

We conclude by stressing that usually EW corrections are particularly large only in phase space regions which are suppressed.
Hence the impact at the level of the total fiducial cross section is usually rather limited.
This is not the case here where the corrections are already large at the level of the cross section and reach $-16\%$ \cite{Biedermann:2016yds}.
The origin of these large EW corrections are virtual corrections and in particular the ones corresponding to the insertion of massive vector particles in the scattering process \cite{Biedermann:2016yds}.
Hence, large NLO EW corrections are an intrinsic feature of VBS at the LHC.
As the EW corrections are particularly large, it might be possible to measure them at a high luminosity LHC, hence probing the EW sector of the SM to very high precision.
This is illustrated on the left-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:VBSEW} where the band represents the estimated statistical error for a high-luminosity LHC collecting $3000~{\rm fb}^{-1}$.

\subsection{Monte Carlo comparisons for ${\rm W^+ W^+}$ scattering}
%  M. Zaro
In the last decade many codes capable of performing VBS simulations have appeared.
Within a network such as VBSCan it is therefore natural to perform 
a quantitative comparison of these programs, both to cross-validate results and to assess the impact of the different approximations which are used.
In fact, already at LO, when considering the process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$ at order $\mathcal O (\alpha^6)$, the various implementations of VBS simulations are different.
They differ, for example,
by the (non-)inclusion of diagrams with vector bosons in the $s$-channel or by the treatment of interferences between diagrams.
The reason of these differences is that, when typical signal cuts for VBS are imposed, these effects turn out to be small on rates and distributions.

In the comparison, the following codes are used: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item The program {\sc Bonsay} consists of a general-purpose Monte Carlo integrator
and matrix elements taken from several sources: Born matrix elements are
adapted from the program {\sc Lusifer} \cite{Dittmaier:2002ap} for the partonic
processes, real matrix elements are written by Marina Billoni, and virtual
matrix elements by Stefan Dittmaier.
One loop integrals are evaluated using the {\sc Collier} library
\cite{Denner:2014gla,Denner:2016kdg}.

  \item {\sc MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} is an automatic meta-code, automatically generating the source code to simulate any scattering process
      including NLO QCD corrections both at fixed order and including matching to parton showers. It makes use of the FKS subtraction method~\cite{Frixione:1995ms,
        Frixione:1997np} (automated in the module {\sc MadFKS}~\cite{Frederix:2009yq,
        Frederix:2016rdc}) for regulating IR singularities. The computations of one-loop amplitudes are carried out by switching dynamically between 
        two integral-reduction techniques, OPP~\cite{Ossola:2006us} or Laurent-series expansion~\cite{Mastrolia:2012bu},
        and TIR~\cite{Passarino:1978jh,Davydychev:1991va,Denner:2005nn}. These have been automated in the module {\sc MadLoop}~\cite{Hirschi:2011pa}, which 
        in turn exploits {\sc CutTools}~\cite{Ossola:2007ax}, {\sc Ninja}~\cite{Peraro:2014cba,
        Hirschi:2016mdz}, or {\sc IREGI}~\cite{ShaoIREGI}, together with an in-house implementation of the {\sc OpenLoops} optimisation~\cite{Cascioli:2011va}.\\
        The simulation of VBS at NLO-QCD accuracy can be performed by issuing the following commands in the program interface:
\begin{verbatim}
> set complex_mass_scheme #1
> import model loop_qcd_qed_sm_Gmu #2
> generate p p > e+ ve mu+ vm j j QCD=0 [QCD] #3
> output #4
\end{verbatim}
  With these commands the complex-mass scheme is turned on {\tt \#1}, then the NLO-capable model is loaded {\tt \#2}\footnote{Despite
            the {\tt loop\_qcd\_qed\_sm\_Gmu} model also includes NLO counterterms for computing electro-weak corrections, it is not yet possible to compute such corrections 
        with the current version of the code.}, finally the process code is generated {\tt \#3} (note the {\tt QCD=0} syntax to select the purely-electroweak process)
        and written to disk {\tt \#4}. Because of some internal limitations, which will be lifted in the future version capable of computing both QCD and EW corrections, 
        only loops with QCD-interacting particles are generated.
  \item The {\sc Powheg-Box}~\cite{Alioli:2010xd,Frixione:2007vw} is a framework for matching NLO-QCD calculations with parton showers.
It relies on the user providing the matrix elements and Born phase space, but will automaticaly construct FKS %\cite{Frixione:1995ms} 
subtraction terms and the phase space for the real emission.
For the VBS processes all matrix elements are being provided by a previous version of {\sc VBFNLO}~\cite{Arnold:2008rz, Arnold:2011wj, Baglio:2014uba} and hence the approximations used in the {\sc Powheg-Box} are the similar to those used in {\sc VBFNLO}.

  \item The program {\sc Recola+MoCaNLO} is made of a flexible Monte Carlo program dubbed {\sc MoCaNLO}~\cite{MoCaNLO} and the general matrix element generator {\sc Recola} \cite{Actis:2012qn,Actis:2016mpe}.
To numerically evaluate the one-loop scalar and tensor integrals, {\sc Recola} relies on the {\sc Collier} library \cite{Denner:2014gla,Denner:2016kdg},
These tools have been successfully used for the computation of the full NLO corrections for VBS~\cite{Biedermann:2016yds,Biedermann:2017bss}.

  \item {\sc VBFNLO}~\cite{Arnold:2008rz, Arnold:2011wj, Baglio:2014uba} is a flexible
parton-level Monte Carlo for processes with electroweak bosons. It
allows the calculation of VBS processes at NLO QCD in the VBF
approximation also including the s-channel triboson contribution,
neglecting interferences between the two. Besides the SM, also anomalous
couplings of the Higgs and gauge bosons can be simulated.

  \item {\sc Whizard}~\cite{Moretti:2001zz,Kilian:2007gr} is a multi-purpose
event generator with the LO matrix element generator {\sc O'Mega}. It
provides FKS subtraction terms for any NLO process, while virtual matrix
elements are provided externally by {\sc
OpenLoops}~\cite{Cascioli:2011va} (alternatively, {\sc Recola}~\cite{Actis:2012qn,Actis:2016mpe}
can be used as well). {\sc Whizard} allows to simulate a
huge number of BSM models as well, in particular for new physics in
the VBS channel in terms of both higher-dimensional operators as well as explicit
resonances.

\end{itemize}

The complete comparison of the codes will be published in a separate work. Here, we present some preliminary results obtained at LO $\mathcal O (\alpha^6)$ and including
NLO QCD corrections at fixed-order $\mathcal O (\alpha^6\alpha_s)$, for the process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$.
In Table~\ref{tab:wg1_codes} the details of the various codes are reported. In particular, it is specified whether:
\begin{itemize}
    \item all $s-$ and $t/u-$channel diagrams that lead to the considered final state are included;
    \item interferences between diagrams are included at LO;
    \item diagrams which do not feature two resonant vector bosons are included;
    \item the so-called non-factorisable (NF) QCD corrections, that is the corrections where (real or virtual) gluons are exchanged between different quark lines,
        are included;
    \item EW corrections to the $\mathcal O (\alpha^5\alpha_s)$ interference are included. These corrections are of the same order as the NLO QCD corrections to
        the  $\mathcal O (\alpha^6$) term.

We simulate VBS production at the LHC, with a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s = 13 \TeV$. We assume five massless flavours in the proton, and employ the NNPDF~3.0 parton 
density~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}
with NLO QCD evolution (the {\tt lhaid} in LHAPDF6~\cite{Buckley:2014ana} for this set is 260000) and strong coupling constant $\alpha_s\left( \MZ \right) = 0.118$. Since
the employed PDF set has no photonic density, photon-induced processes are not considered. Initial-state collinear singularities are factorised with the  ${\overline{\rm MS}}$ 
scheme, consistently with what is done in NNPDF.\\
We use the following values for the mass and width of the massive particles:
% 
\begin{alignat}{2}
                  \Mt   &=  173.21\GeV,       & \quad \quad \quad \Gt &= 0 \GeV,  \nonumber \\
                \MZOS &=  91.1876\GeV,      & \quad \quad \quad \GZOS &= 2.4952\GeV,  \nonumber \\
                \MWOS &=  80.385\GeV,       & \GWOS &= 2.085\GeV,  \nonumber \\
                M_{\rm H} &=  125.0\GeV,       &  \GH   &=  4.07 \times 10^{-3}\GeV.
\end{alignat}
%
The pole masses and widths of the W and Z~bosons are obtained from the measured on-shell (OS) values \cite{Bardin:1988xt} according to
%
\begin{equation}
M_V = \frac{\MVOS}{\sqrt{1+(\GVOS/\MVOS)^2}},\qquad  
\Gamma_V = \frac{\GVOS}{\sqrt{1+(\GVOS/\MVOS)^2}}.
\end{equation}
%
The EW coupling is renormalised in the $G_\mu$ scheme \cite{Denner:2000bj} where
\begin{equation}
    G_{\mu}    = 1.16637\times 10^{-5}\GeV^{-2}.
\end{equation}
The derived value of the EW coupling $\alpha$, corresponding to our choice of input parameters, is 
\begin{equation}
 \alpha = 7.555310522369 \times 10^{-3}. \\
\end{equation}
We employ the complex-mass scheme~\cite{Denner:1999gp,Denner:2005fg} to treat unstable intermediate particles in a gauge-invariant manner.\\

Cross sections and distribution are computed within the following VBS cuts inspired from experimental measurements \cite{Aad:2014zda,Aaboud:2016ffv,Khachatryan:2014sta,CMS:2017adb}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The two same-sign charged leptons are required to have
        \begin{align}
         \ptsub{\Pl} >  20\GeV,\qquad |y_{\Pl}| < 2.5, \qquad \Delta R_{\Pl\Pl}> 0.3\,.
        \end{align}
    \item The total missing transverse energy, computed from the vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of the two neutrinos in the event,
        is required to be
        \begin{align}
          \etsub{\text{miss}}=p_{\rm T, miss} >  40\GeV\,.
        \end{align}
    \item QCD partons (quark and gluons) are clustered together using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with distance parameter $R=0.4$. Jets are required
        to have
        \begin{align}
         \ptsub{\Pj} >  30\GeV, \qquad |y_\Pj| < 4.5, \qquad \Delta R_{\Pj\Pl} > 0.3 \,.
        \end{align}
        On the two jets with largest transverse-momentum the following invariant-mass and rapidity-separation cuts are imposed
        \begin{align}
         m_{\Pj \Pj} >  500\GeV,\qquad |\Delta y_{\Pj \Pj}| > 2.5.
        \end{align}
%         Finally, all jest in the event are required to be separated from charged leptons:
%         \begin{align}
%          \qquad\Delta R_{\Pj\Pl} > 0.3 .
%         \end{align}
    \item When EW corrections are computed, real photons and charged fermion are clustered together using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with 
        radius parameter $R=0.1$. In this case, leptons and quarks mentioned above must be understood as {\it dressed fermions}. Photons
        which are not combined at this step are clustered with QCD partons to form jets as it is described previously.

In Table~\ref{tab:wg1_LOrates} we report the total rates at LO accuracy obtained with the set-up described above, and in Figure~\ref{fig:wg1_mjj-llLO} we show the results
for the tagging-jet (left) and lepton-pair (right) invariant-mass distribution. In both case we show the absolute distributions in the main frame of the 
figures, while in the inset the ratio over {\sc VBFNLO} is displayed. For both observables we find 
a relatively good agreement among the various tools, which confirms the fact
that contributions from $s$-channel diagrams as well as from non-resonant configurations are strongly suppressed in the fiducial region.
At NLO, rates show slightly larger discrepancies, as it can be observed in Table~\ref{tab:wg1_NLOrates}. This is most likely due to low dijet invariant-mass configurations, where
$s$-channel diagrams and interferences are less suppressed than at LO, because of the presence of extra QCD radiation.

We conclude this section by recalling that the results presented must be regarded as preliminary.
In the coming months, this work will be enlarged to include comparison of predictions at NLO QCD matched to parton shower or with EW corrections, 
as well as to study the effect of changing 
the VBS cuts. The QCD-induced background will also be studied.

\subsection{Polarisation of vector bosons}
% E. Maina

Processes related to new physics could disturb the delicate balance which preserves unitarity
in VBS  between longitudinally polarised vector bosons
and lead to potentially large enhancements of the VBS rate, making it the ideal process for searches of 
deviations from the SM and hints of New Physics. 
Developing methods which allow the separation of the different vector polarisations is, therefore, of primary
relevance.
A new technique has been proposed and applied to the scattering of two W bosons of opposite charge
\cite{Ballestrero:2017bxn}.

The basic tool has been known for a long time.
The polarisation tensor in the W propagator can be expressed in terms of polarisation vectors:
\begin{equation}
-g^{\mu\nu} + \frac{k^{\mu}k^{\nu}}{M^2} = \sum_{\lambda = 1}^4 \varepsilon^{\mu}_\lambda(k) 
\varepsilon^{\nu^*}_{\lambda}(k)\,\,.
\end{equation}

The decay amplitudes of the W depend on its polarisation.
In the rest frame of the $\ell\nu$ pair, they are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:longamp}
\mathcal{M^D}_0 = ig\,\sqrt{2}E \,\sin\theta \,\,,\quad
\mathcal{M^D}_{R/L} = ig\,E \,(1 \pm \cos\theta)e^{\pm i\phi} \,\,,
\end{equation}
 where $0,R,L$ refer to the longitudinal, right and left polarisations and $(\theta, \phi)$ are the charged 
 lepton angles relative to the boson direction.
Hence, each physical polarisation is uniquely associated with a specific angular distribution of the charged
lepton.    

Two issues, however, remain unresolved: 

\begin{itemize}
\item With few exceptions, electroweak boson production processses are described by amplitudes
including non resonant diagrams, which cannot be interpreted as
production times decay of any vector boson.
These diagrams are essential for gauge invariance and cannot be ignored.
For them, separating polarisations is simply unfeasible. 
\item Since the  W's are unstable particles, the decays of the indidual 
polarisations interfere among themselves.
 \end{itemize} 

In order to define amplitudes with definite $W$ polarisation, it is necessary to devise an accurate 
approximation to the full result that only involves double resonant diagrams.
Reference~\cite{Ballestrero:2017bxn} employed an on-shell projection (OSP) method,
similar to the procedure employed for
the calculation of EW radiative corrections to W$^+$W$^-$ production in
reference~\cite{Denner:2000bj}.
 
It consists in substituting the momentum of the $\ell\nu$ pair  with a momentum on the W mass shell, 
while the denominator in the W propagator is left untouched. However,
this projection is not uniquely defined. In order to have an unambiguous
prescription one can choose to conserve:
the total four--momentum of the WW system (thus, also $M_{WW}$ is conserved);
the direction of the two W bosons in the WW center of mass frame;
the angles of each charged lepton, in the corresponding W center of mass frame, relative to the boson
direction in the lab.
This procedure is gauge invariant. 

 If, for instance, one considers a polarised W$^-$
 boson and a non-polarised W$^+$ one, once all non double resonant diagrams have been dropped and the
 resonant ones have been projected,
the squared amplitude becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interfpol}
\underbrace{\left|\mathcal{M}\right|^2}_{\textrm{coherent sum}} = \underbrace{\sum_{\lambda}\left|
\mathcal{M}_{\lambda}\right|^2}_{\textrm{incoherent sum}} + \underbrace{\sum_{\lambda \neq \lambda'}
\mathcal{M}_{\lambda}^{ *}\mathcal{M}_{\lambda'}}_{\textrm{interference terms}}\,.
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the W$^-$ polarisation.
In the absence of cuts on the final state leptons, the interference terms in Equation~\ref{eq:interfpol} cancel upon 
integration and the projected cross section is simply the sum of singly polarised cross sections. 
In the W center of mass frame the charged lepton angular distribution is: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sigma(X)} \,\,\frac{d\sigma(\theta,X)}{d\cos\theta}
\ =\  \frac{3}{8} (1 + \cos\theta)^2 \,f_L
    + \frac{3}{8} (1 - \cos\theta)^2 \,f_R
    + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2\theta \, f_0 \,,
\label{eq:dcdist}
\end{equation}

The coherent sum of  OSP polarised amplitudes differs by about one percent from the exact cross section.
The differential distributions which do not depend on decay products of the
W bosons are equally well described.
Other variables, like the transverse momentum or the
angle $\phi$ of the electron, show sizable differences  between the exact distributions and the projected 
ones.
The polarisation fractions obtained with a Legendre analysis and through direct computation of singly 
polarised processes agree.

$M_{WW}$ (right).}
\label{fig:distrib_thetal_polfrac_lepcut}
\end{figure} 

The approach proposed in ref~\cite{Ballestrero:2017bxn} can be applied also when
standard acceptance cuts ($p_t^{\ell}>20 \,\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and
 $|\eta^{\ell}| < 2.5$) are imposed on both charged leptons.

The coherent sum of  OSP polarised amplitudes differs from the full result by about 2\%.
The interference among polarisations is generally small. 
 
The distributions obtained from the incoherent sum of three OSP distributions agree  well with the full 
result for variables which do not depend on the W decay products.
The individual polarisations are not affected equally by the cuts. Typically, the cross section for right--
handed W's 
is reduced the most, followed by the cross section for longitudinally polarised W's. Left--handed W 
bosons seem to be the least sensitive to acceptance cuts.

The full angular distribution, Figure~\ref{fig:distrib_thetal_lepcut},
is approximated within a few percent, over the full range, by the sum of the 
unpolarised distributions. 
The exact result, shown by the black histogram, however, is not of the form of equation~\ref{eq:dcdist}.
This becomes clear expanding the full result on the first three Legendre polynomials,
which yields the blue, green, and orange smooth 
curves in Figure~\ref{fig:distrib_thetal_polfrac_lepcut}. Their sum is the smooth black curve which fails to describe 
the correct distribution.
Even in the presence of cuts, the fraction of longitudinally polarised W$^-$'s is well above 10\%.

The fact that the exact distribution is well described by the incoherent sum of the polarised differential 
distributions
allows for a measurement of the polarisation fractions, within a single model,
even in the presence of cuts on the charged
leptons, using Montecarlo templates for the fit. 

This analysis demonstrates that it is possible to study the polarisation of massive gauge
bosons in a well defined set-up for vector-boson scattering processes. The  method has been 
implemented in the code Phantom \cite{Ballestrero:2007xq}.


\subsection{Effective Field theory for vector-boson scattering}
% I. Brivio

VBS processes represent a particularly interesting probe of new physics, as they give a unique access to the couplings of gauge bosons.
Without committing to a specific model, a convenient instrument for testing experimental data against the presence of BSM effects is that of Effective Field Theories (EFTs).

In a EFT approach, the SM is assumed to be the low energy limit of an unknown UV completion, whose typical scale $\Lambda$ is well separated from the electroweak one.
In this scenario the new physics sector is decoupled and its impact onto observables measured at $E\sim v$ can be parametrised without specifying any property of the UV completion, by means of a Lagrangian that contains only the SM fields and respects the SM symmetries.
New physics effects are organized in a Taylor expansion in $E/\Lambda$, \emph{i.e.}\ they are encoded in an infinite series of gauge-invariant operators ordered by their canonical dimension.
This is often called SMEFT (SM EFT) Lagrangian and, neglecting lepton number violating terms, it reads
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L}_{\rm SMEFT} = \mathcal{L}_{\rm SM} + \frac{1}{\Lambda^2}\mathcal{L}_{\rm dim-6} + \frac{1}{\Lambda^4}\mathcal{L}_{\rm dim-8} + \dots
\end{equation} 
with the dots standing for higher orders.
The SMEFT Lagrangian constitutes a convenient theoretical tool for probing the presence of new physics, as it provides the only systematic and model-independent parametrisation of new physics effects that can be matched onto any UV completion compatible with the SM symmetries and field content.

We can restrict to leading deviations from the SM cutting the series at dimension 6 which reads
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L}_{\rm dim-6} = \sum_i C_i \mathcal{O}_i\, .
\end{equation} 
Here $\{\mathcal{O}_i\}$ is a set of gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators that form a complete basis and $\{C_i\}$ are the corresponding Wilson coefficients.
%
Any evidence for a non-zero Wilson coefficient would represent a smoking gun of new physics.
Further, knowing which terms are non-vanishing can allow to characterise the new physics states and help designing more effective direct search strategies.


A complete basis for dimension-6 terms contains 59 independent structures (+ their hermitian conjugates) that in complete generality are associated to 2499 independent parameters~\cite{Alonso:2013hga}.
This number can be significantly reduced by assuming CP conservation and/or an approximate $U(3)^5$ flavour symmetry.
Choosing convenient kinematic cuts in the experimental measurements can also help to restrict the set of relevant operators.
Different basis choices for $\mathcal{L}_{\rm dim-6}$ have been proposed in the literature, that are related by equation-of-motion and integration-by-parts transformations. 
Despite containing different sets of operators (often distributing the effects differently among fermions and bosons couplings), all the bases give equivalent parametrisations for physical $S$-matrix elements, \emph{i.e.}\ once a complete process with stable external states is computed. 
The so-called Warsaw basis~\cite{Grzadkowski:2010es} is sometimes preferred, due to the fact that this was the first complete basis in the literature and that its renormalisation group evolution (RGE) and one-loop finite renormalisation are completely known~\cite{Jenkins:2013zja,Jenkins:2013wua,Alonso:2013hga,Grojean:2013kd,Alonso:2014zka,Ghezzi:2015vva}.


% \vskip 1em
Assuming CP conservation and a $U(3)^5$ flavour symmetry, VBS processes receive corrections from 16 dimension-6 operators.
To keep the analysis as general as possible and to have a well-defined IR limit of a given underlying UV sector, these should be all considered simultaneously in the fit.
Setting a subset of the Wilson coefficients to zero cannot be done arbitrarily.
For example, this may spoil strong correlations hidden in the parametrisation and artificially remove blind 
directions\footnote{From a theoretical point of view, removing operators arbitrarily is problematic because a given basis is a minimal set in which a vast amount of redundant structures have already been systematically removed.
This means that each operator retained in the basis does not simply account for corrections to the couplings that it contains, but also to those contained in other structures related to it \emph{e.g.}\ by equations of motion, that have been removed.
This happens in a non-intuitive way, which is hard to control a posteriori.
For instance in the Warsaw basis some operators affecting triple gauge couplings (TGCs) are traded for a specific combination of fermionic + Higgs terms, which are apparently unrelated to the self-couplings of the gauge bosons.}.
In particular, including anomalous fermion couplings may have a significant impact on the analysis, despite the strong constraints imposed by LEP measurements (see \emph{e.g.}\ reference~\cite{Baglio:2017bfe} for a recent study in the context of W$^+$ W$^-$ production at the LHC).
A reduction of the number of parameters may be necessary, nonetheless, for the technical feasibility of the analysis. In this case the removal of some (combination of) operators may be  very carefully considered in the future.

The possibility of extending the EFT analysis with dimension-8 operators has also been discussed, as these terms can introduce important decorrelation effects between triple and quartic gauge couplings.
Although this is an interesting avenue, exploring it in a consistent way is a challenging task due to the extremely large number of parameters involved 
(considering one fermion generation, there are 895 B-conserving independent operators at $d=8$, among which up to 86 can contribute to quartic gauge couplings (QGCs) and TGCs~\cite{Henning:2015alf}) 
and to the fact that a complete basis of dimension-8 operators is not available to date. 
Therefore it is advisable to defer this study to a later stage. A more compelling alternative is rather performing an analysis in the basis of the Higgs EFT (HEFT), 
for which complete bases have been presented in Refs.~\cite{Buchalla:2013rka,Brivio:2016fzo} (see references therein for further theoretical details and previous phenomenological studies).
The HEFT differs from the SMEFT in that it is not 
constructed with the Higgs doublet, but rather embedding the Goldstone fields into a dimensionless matrix $\mathbf{U}=\exp(i\pi^a\sigma^a/v)$ (analogously to the pion fields in chiral perturbation theory) and treating the physical Higgs as a gauge singlet. The HEFT is more general than the SMEFT and it matches the low energy limit, for instance, of some theories with a strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector in the UV, such as composite Higgs models.
Such an analysis would be highly motivated as the scattering of longitudinal gauge bosons constitutes one of the best probes for UV scenarios matching the HEFT (see \emph{e.g.}\ Refs.~\cite{Delgado:2013hxa,Delgado:2014jda} for recent studies), and they are among the observables that may allow to disentangle it from the SMEFT. The number of relevant Wilson coefficients for VBS in the HEFT (in the CP conserving, $U(3)^5$ symmetric limit) is about 30, which is larger than for the SMEFT but much lower than for including a complete dimension-8 set of operators, 
which makes this analysis an ideal follow-up to the SMEFT one.

One of the main points to be addressed in the EFT analysis is that of the EFT validity: as mentioned above, adopting a dimension-6 parametrisation is theoretically justified only for $\Lambda$ sufficiently larger than $v$. Namely the impact of dimension-8 terms $\sim (E/\Lambda)^4$ should be roughly smaller than the experimental uncertainty. When analysing experimental data, however, the cutoff scale $\Lambda$ is unknown and the actual energy $E$ exchanged in the process is often unaccessible too. Extracting $E$ is particularly complex for VBS at the LHC, with various scales entering at different stages in the (sub-)process(es).
Thus the validity of the EFT cannot be established a priori: at best it can be verified a posteriori, checking that the energy range of the distributions used for the fit does not exceed the lower limit obtained for the cutoff. Some methods of this kind have been discussed in the literature (see e.g.~\cite{Busoni:2013lha,Buchmueller:2013dya,Biekoetter:2014jwa,Englert:2014cva,Racco:2015dxa,Contino:2016jqw,Brivio:2017ije}) and could also be applied to VBS studies.
If a constraint is found to be incompatible with the validity of the EFT itself, it should be rejected.
Attention should be paid to the application of unitarisation methods, that are often employed to correct the divergences obtained in the kinematic distributions of Monte Carlo generated signals. Introducing a damping of the distribution tails, these techniques may alter the behavior of the Taylor series in a way that does not reflect the correct behavior of the EFT at high energies (which is indeed divergent where the expansion breaks down) and lead to an incorrect estimation of the constraints.

The first step of the EFT-VBS program is an accurate theoretical study of VBS in the SMEFT at dimension-6, which includes agreeing on a given parametrisation, evaluating the necessity of reducing the number of operators considered and testing the capabilities of available theoretical tools (Monte Carlo generators etc).
This will be conducted in parallel with a preliminary study of the experimental constraints that could be obtained. One of the primary goals of these studies, in which both theorists and experimentalists will participate, is to define an optimal way to report data (cross sections and differential distributions) that maximizes the transparency and versatility of the results.
Finally, further avenues are worth exploring in a subsequent stages, among which the analysis of the HEFT basis (and later on, if possible, of dimension-8 operators) and a comparison of the impact of VBS processes with that of other datasets, with the possibility of considering a combination of different measurements in the fit.
